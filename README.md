## Frontend

This is the frontend of Omniport.

## Technological satck

- Server: `Webpack dev server`
- Routing: `React Router`

A Dockerised setup is the preferred mode of installation. One such is provided 
by us on our GitHub account. You can however set all the components up yourself, 
after suffering a reasonable amount of headbanging, cursing, and physical and 
mental pain.

This can be found at `https://github.com/IMGIITRoorkee/omniport-docker`.
