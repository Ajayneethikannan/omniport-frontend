> The frontend of the one true portal for any and every educational institute

## Frontend

Omniport is a portal for educational institutes, designed from the ground up to
be extensible, customizable, performant and powerful. Omniport also comes with 
a powerful collection of apps and is simple enough for you to be able to write
your own.

## Technological satck

- Language: `Javascript`
- Library: `React`
- JavaScript bundler: `Webpack`
- Server: `Webpack dev server`
- Routing: `React Router`
- State management: `Redux`
- UI Framework: `Semantic UI React`
- CSS: `CSS Modules`

A Dockerised setup is the preferred mode of installation. One such is provided

after suffering a reasonable amount of headbanging, cursing, and physical and 
mental pain.
